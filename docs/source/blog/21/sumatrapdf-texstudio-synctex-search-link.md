# Create search link between SumatraPDF and TeXstudio with SyncTeX

I use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for my LaTeX works.
[SumatraPDF](sumatrapdf.md) is also good, lightweight PDF reader. It is possible
to create a forward search from TeXstudio to SumatraPDF. You may find PDF output
of a LaTeX code. Similarly, a backward search is possible: find LaTeX source
code from PDF output.

Given steps are tested by using **TeXstudio 2.10.8** and **SumatraPDF v3.1.1
64-bit** on a **Windows 7 64-bit** machine. However, I am pretty sure it will
work for almost all possible future and previous versions.

> This post will be based on this article
(`http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/texstudio-sumatrapdf/` `404 🔗`) But since it
was published in 2011, there are some slight changes in software menus. You may
also read it.

1- Open TexStudio. Navigate **Options** → **Configure TeXstutdio…**

```{figure} assets/sumatra-link-a.png
:align: center

Configure TeXstudio…
```

2- Click **Commands** tab, and find **External PDF Viewer** option.

```{figure} assets/sumatra-link-b.png
:align: center

External PDF Viewer…
```

3- Change the field with:

```text
"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -reuse-instance %.pdf
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

> **Update (08 Feb 2015):** I use pdflatex. According to Vojtech Vozda (see
comments), if you use DVI → PS → PDF chain you should also add `-synctex=1` option
to LaTeX part as in PdfLaTeX option in order to create search link between your
source code and PDF file. See also: [What exactly is
SyncTeX?](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/118489/what-exactly-is-synctex)

4- Click **Build** tab, find **PDF Viewer** option and change it to **External
PDF Viewer.**

```{figure} assets/sumatra-link-c.png
:align: center

Use External PDF Viewer
```

5- On the same windows, locate **User Commands** tab.

```{figure} assets/sumatra-link-d.png
:align: center

User Commands
```

Add the following statements:

```text
user0:Forward Search
```

to the first column and

```text
dde:///"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe":SUMATRA/control/  [ForwardSearch("?am.pdf","?c:am.tex",@,0,0,1)]
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

Click **OK**

6- Now let’s open **Options** → **Configure TeXstutdio…** again and select
**Shortcuts** tab. Expand **Menus** → **Tools** → **User** tree. Now you should
see a user command called **Forward Search**. Now its default shortcut is
**Alt+Shift+F1**. But you can also assign another shortcut to forward search
like **F2**. But this step is optional.

User Commands Shortcut
```

7- Now we are done with TeXstudio. Let’s set up SumatraPDF. Open SumatraPDF.
Click **Settings** → **Options**.

```{figure} assets/sumatra-link-f.png
:align: center

Sumatra Settings
```

8- Locate **Set inverse search command-line**.

> **Update (19 Feb 2016):** 8.a is added.

8.a- If you don’t see "Set inverse search command-line" option and options
window is ended by "SumatraPDF is your default PDF reader" button, first do this
step.

Run the following command. (Windows Start → Search for cmd.exe → Open cmd.exe →
Paste the following code → Press Enter)

```text
"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -inverse-search
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

This command will open SumatraPDF but it will give a loading error. This isn’t
important. Now open options again and you should see the inverse search option
as given below.

```{figure} assets/sumatra-link-g.png
:align: center

Sumatra Inverse Search
```

Type:

```text
"C:\Program Files (x86)\TeXstudio\texstudio.exe" "%f" -line %l
```

You should put **your** path to texstudio.exe between quotation marks.

Click **OK** and exit.

Now **let’s try your new setup.**

Compile a LaTeX code in TeXstudio and produce PDF output. If you press **F2**
(if you assign that shortcut in TeXstudio settings), SumatraPDF should highlight
corresponding output of your cursor position. In SumatraPDF, double-clicking
shows corresponding LaTeX code in TeXstudio.
