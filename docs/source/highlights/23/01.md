# Highlights 23-01

This article was published on October 8, 2023. It covers the week of October 2,
2023.

## üì∞ What's happening?

- Raspberry Pi Foundation announced **Raspberry Pi 5**. It will be available on
  October 2023. 4GB RAM: $60, 8GB RAM: $80. Quad core 64-bit ARM A76 CPU [^1f].
  **Now, Raspberry Pi has its own silicon (ASIC) on the Raspberry Pi board: RP1
  (an I/O chip).** Notice that the RP2040 on [Raspberry Pi
  Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) was also
  designed by the team [^4f]. Unlike the older Raspberry Pi versions, an active
  cooling solution is highly recommended by the team for 5. Now, they are
  introducing two new official hardware solutions for cooling, priced at $5 and
  $10 respectively. An interesting part of the incoming 5 is that it provides
  **PCIe (x4, Gen 2.0)** connection via a [FPC
  connector.](https://connectorsupplier.com/meet-the-connector-ffc-fpc-connectors/)

- Intel announced **Agilex¬Æ 3 FPGA and SoC FPGA** portfolio. These chips are optimized
  for power and cost. There will be two different Agilex¬Æ 3 FPGA series: B and C
  series. With release of 3 series Intel has Agilex¬Æ 3, 5, 7 and 9
  now. All Agilex¬Æ products are manufactured by Intel fabs [^2f].

- Intel released **Quartus¬Æ Prime 23.3** [^3f].
- **Is ALTERA coming back?** Intel announced that they are reorganizing their
  FPGA group (Programmable Solutions Group, PSG) into a separate business unit
  starting in 2024 [^6f], [^7f], [^8f], [^9f]. They said that they are
  positioning PSG to more effectively compete in the FPGA market. Intel had
  bought **ALTERA for $16.7 billion in 2015** [^10f]. Of course, the name will
  not be ALTERA (probably). As an engineer working with FPGAs, I hope that this
  won't "hurt" developers working with Intel FPGAs in the long run. **Will we
  see a similar approach by AMD for Xilinx?**

  > let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve got my popcorn ready

- [Teledyne Technologies Incorporated](https://www.teledynelecroy.com/)
  announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Xena Networks
  [^5f]. [Xena Networks](https://xenanetworks.com/) is a provider of high-speed
  **Terabit Ethernet** validation, quality assurance, and production test
  solutions.
- This news could be interesting to **embedded** and **Android developers**.
  This week, **ARM** announced an important security issue related to ARM Mali
  GPUs [^11f]. The security bug potentially affects many mobile phones,
  including Google's Pixels, Samsung S20 and S21, Redmi Note 11 and 12 and many
  more. ARM states that:

  > A local non-privileged user can make improper GPU processing operations to
  > access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds or to exploit a software
  > race condition. If the system‚Äôs memory is carefully prepared by the user,
  > then this in turn could give them access to already freed memory.

  An interesting method, right? Probably, the issue will be fixed by a kernel
  driver update.

## ü§ì Me

This week I got a copy of [Blue Fox: Arm Assembly Internals and Reverse
Engineering](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Blue+Fox:+Arm+Assembly+Internals+and+Reverse+Engineering-p-9781119745303)
by [Maria "Azeria"
Markstedter](https://www.forbes.com/profile/maria-markstedter). I could only do
a quick skim but reviews are very positive. Hopefully, I can start reading it in
a couple of weeks.
