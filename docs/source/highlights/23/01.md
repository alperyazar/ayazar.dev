# Highlights 23-01

This article was published on October 8, 2023. It covers the week of October 2,
2023.

## üì∞ What's happening?

- Raspberry Pi Foundation announced **Raspberry Pi 5**. It will be available on
  October 2023. 4GB RAM: $60, 8GB RAM: $80. Quad core 64-bit ARM A76 CPU [^1f].
  **Now, Raspberry Pi has its own silicon (ASIC) on the Raspberry Pi board: RP1
  (an I/O chip).** Notice that the RP2040 on [Raspberry Pi
  Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) was also
  designed by the team [^4f]. Unlike the older Raspberry Pi versions, an active
  cooling solution is highly recommended by the team for 5. Now, they are
  introducing two new official hardware solutions for cooling, priced at $5 and
  $10 respectively. An interesting part of the incoming 5 is that it provides
  **PCIe (x4, Gen 2.0)** connection via a [FPC
  connector.](https://connectorsupplier.com/meet-the-connector-ffc-fpc-connectors/)

  The official announcement video:

- Intel announced **Agilex¬Æ 3 FPGA and SoC FPGA** portfolio. These chips are optimized
  for power and cost. There will be two different Agilex¬Æ 3 FPGA series: B and C
  series. With release of 3 series Intel has Agilex¬Æ 3, 5, 7 and 9
  now. All Agilex¬Æ products are manufactured by Intel fabs [^2f].

- Intel released **Quartus¬Æ Prime 23.3** [^3f].
- **Is ALTERA coming back?** Intel announced that they are reorganizing their
  FPGA group (Programmable Solutions Group, PSG) into a separate business unit
  starting in 2024 [^6f], [^7f], [^8f], [^9f]. They said that they are
  positioning PSG to more effectively compete in the FPGA market. Intel had
  bought **ALTERA for $16.7 billion in 2015** [^10f]. Of course, the name will
  not be ALTERA (probably). As an engineer working with FPGAs, I hope that this
  won't "hurt" developers working with Intel FPGAs in the long run. **Will we
  see a similar approach by AMD for Xilinx?**

  comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/16zpwmh/comment/k3g5xs8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
  from the Reddit post by `Equivalent_Rule_3406`

  > From a technical standpoint I welcome this move, from a business perspective
  > let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôve got my popcorn ready

- [Teledyne Technologies Incorporated](https://www.teledynelecroy.com/)
  announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Xena Networks
  [^5f]. [Xena Networks](https://xenanetworks.com/) is a provider of high-speed
  **Terabit Ethernet** validation, quality assurance, and production test
  solutions.
- This news could be interesting to **embedded** and **Android developers**.
  This week, **ARM** announced an important security issue related to ARM Mali
  GPUs [^11f]. The security bug potentially affects many mobile phones,
  including Google's Pixels, Samsung S20 and S21, Redmi Note 11 and 12 and many
  more. ARM states that:

  > A local non-privileged user can make improper GPU processing operations to
  > access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds or to exploit a software
  > race condition. If the system‚Äôs memory is carefully prepared by the user,
  > then this in turn could give them access to already freed memory.

  An interesting method, right? Probably, the issue will be fixed by a kernel
  driver update.
- An article on RISC-V and US-China tech war from Reuters:
  [US-China tech war: RISC-V chip technology emerges as new battleground](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-china-tech-war-risc-v-chip-technology-emerges-new-battleground-2023-10-06)
  In summary:

  > The U.S.-China tech competition has extended to RISC-V, an open-source chip
  > technology also used in China. Some lawmakers want restrictions on American
  > companies working with RISC-V, citing national security concerns. They fear
  > China is exploiting open collaboration to boost its semiconductor industry.
  > Imposing regulations on American firms in this context could disrupt tech
  > collaboration and chip innovation, but it's being considered due to national
  > security worries.
- OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT and DALL-E, said to be considering developing its
  own AI chips [^12f]. In summary:

  > OpenAI is considering developing its own AI chips due to the chip shortage
  > for training AI models. They may acquire a chip manufacturer or design chips
  > internally. The high demand for GPUs, currently used by OpenAI, has strained
  > the supply chain. Other tech giants like Google and Amazon have already
  > created their own AI chips. OpenAI has substantial funding, but the AI chip
  > business can be challenging and costly, with other companies facing
  > difficulties. This endeavor may take years and is a risky bet for OpenAI's
  > investors, including Microsoft.

- **Glibc** (de facto C library for almost all Linux distro, including embedded
  ones) is facing a critical local privilege escalation vulnerability which
  allows user to gain **root privileges** [^13f]. **Almost all distros except
  Alpine Linux** are vulnerable to this since [Alpine
  Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) doesn't use glibc üòé. In summary:

  > A serious vulnerability in Glibc's dynamic loader has been discovered,
  > allowing local users to gain full root privileges. It affects various Linux
  > distributions from the past two years, and updates to fix the issue are
  > expected soon.

- **Andorid 14** released [^14f], [^15f].
- **Richard Stallman (RMS)**, founder of the Free Software Foundation and initiator
  of the GNU project, announced that he has cancer at the conference celebrating
  GNU's 40th anniversary. He is doing fine now. I would like to send this
  legendary guy my best wishes, as an engineer who uses the tools created by
  him in every day.

## üëç Recommended This Week

This week, I recommend [The Embedded
Muse](http://www.ganssle.com/tem-subunsub.html), biweekly newsletter especially
for embedded developers, from a guru, **Jack Ganssle**, since 1997! Here is the
interview with Jack Ganssle by EEVBlog (Dave Jones):

## ü§ì Me

This week I got a copy of [Blue Fox: Arm Assembly Internals and Reverse
Engineering](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Blue+Fox:+Arm+Assembly+Internals+and+Reverse+Engineering-p-9781119745303)

Markstedter](https://www.forbes.com/profile/maria-markstedter). I could only do
a quick skim but reviews are very positive. Hopefully, I can start reading it in
a couple of weeks.
