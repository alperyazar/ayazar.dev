This article was published on October x, 2023. It mostly covers events that
occurred during the week of October 9, 2023.

## 📰 What's happening?

- **FreeRTOS** has **asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP)** support already but now the kernel is also supporting symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) [^2f]. Please keep in mind that this feature is not in upstream yet, still testing.  
- **FreeRTOS+TCP** now has both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP/IP Stack with the release of v4.0 [^1f].

  > TCP/IP parsing code is checked for memory safety with the CBMC bounded model checker. In addition, FreeRTOS+TCP has been penetration tested, is MISRA-C compliant, and undergone both Coverity static analysis and protocol testing.
