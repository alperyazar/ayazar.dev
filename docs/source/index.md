Hello, I’m **Alper Yazar**. I have been working as an electronics
engineer since 2012.

My main areas of expertise include **embedded systems, Linux, digital design,
FPGAs, and electronics design**. Since I work in a wide range of fields, I
describe myself as a ["Full Stack Electronics"
Engineer](blog/23/full-stack-elektronik.md).

On this personal website, I mostly share my **technical notes and personal
thoughts**.
