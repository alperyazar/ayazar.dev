# ❤️ Support

Since you've reached this page, I assume you enjoyed at least one of the
contents I’ve shared. **First of all, I appreciate that.**

*Or maybe you just clicked the ❤️ icon in the bottom right corner out of
curiosity—either way, that’s fine too!*

Here’s how you can support my work:

## Leave a comment

💭 If you like my content and want to support me, **the best way to do so is by
sharing your comments, feedback, and suggestions under the related post.** This
way, I can learn from your perspectives and respond accordingly. Discussing
different ideas helps everyone learn new things and improve their understanding.

## Submit a Pull Request

🔀 If you notice any mistakes in my content, you can point them out in the
comments under the respective post. Even better, if you have the skills, you can
directly correct the source code of the page and submit a *Pull Request* via
GitHub. This way, you’ll be making a direct contribution! Each page has an *Edit
on GitHub* link at the top—you can click on it to make changes.

If you’re thinking, *I don’t have time for this* or *I’m not sure how to do it*
(though, if you’re interested in software development, I highly recommend
learning to work with Git and GitHub), no worries! Your comments and suggestions
are still greatly valued.

## Share with your friends

👥 If you find the content useful, **sharing it with your friends or on social
media platforms** is also a great way to support me. (This doesn’t provide
direct benefits to me, but who wouldn’t want their work to reach more people?)

## Support Financially 💳

🤑 I create this content without any financial expectations. However,
if you’d like to offer financial support, that’s also appreciated! Maybe I’ll
get myself a few more development boards 🤓.

For those who wish to contribute, I believe the most suitable platform, at least
for me to get the payment easily, is **YouTube**. You can become a [channel
member](https://www.youtube.com/@ayazar/membership) on my [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ayazar), providing ongoing support with a
monthly contribution. Alternatively, you can make a one-time contribution by
using *Super Thanks* (called `Teşekkürler` in Turkish) on [any
video](https://www.youtube.com/@ayazar/videos)—the choice is yours!

ℹ️ After platform fees and deductions, the actual amount received is typically
less than half of the original contribution.

**A Special Request**

If you are a university student or younger, I kindly ask that you **do NOT make
any financial contributions**—even if you have some income from internships,
part-time jobs, allowances, or scholarships. I’ve noticed that some young
students support me through YouTube payments, and while I deeply appreciate that
they find my content valuable, I would be much happier if they spent that money
on themselves instead.

Please, use the amount you intended to send me to buy yourself a Udemy course, a
development board, a nice meal, or save it for your future education. That would
genuinely make me happier. The same applies to recent graduates who are not yet
earning an income—I also strongly encourage you **not** to contribute
financially.

Please respect my request…
