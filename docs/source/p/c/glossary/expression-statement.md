# expression statement (ifade deyimi)

If we put a semicolon `;` to the end of an [](expression.md), this expression
becomes an expression statement. `;` is a **terminator** in that case. `;` acts
like a `.` in English, a punctuation mark indicating end of a sentence. We make
*sentences* by putting `;` at end of expressions.

```text
<expression statement> = <expression>;
```

```c
10;        //expression statement
x;         //expression statement
x = 10;    //expression statement
foo();     //expression statement
z = x + y; //expression statement
```
