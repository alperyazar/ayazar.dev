# non-constant expression (sabit olmayan ifade)

This is the opposite of [](constant-expression.md). Typically, value of
non-constant expressions can't be calculated during compilation phase. Machine
codes to calculate value of non-constant expressions are generated by the
compiler and values are calculated during runtime. Non-constant expressions
contain at least one variable (or an identifier) typically.

```c
x      //non-constant expression
x + 5  //non-constant expression
foo()  //non-constant expression
```
