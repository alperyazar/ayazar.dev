# 📜 History of C

C is a pretty old language. C is a byproduct of the UNIX project. UNIX led to
development of C and C helped UNIX to gain further success. Today, most of the
programming languages have been designed by broad teams for specific purposes. C
is different. C was almost improvised during development of UNIX to help the
UNIX project. I think C has a soul behind it. Maybe the soul behind the language
made it more successful, who knows…

## 70s

The history of the C programming language dates back to 1969. [Ken
Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) started to develop a
language called B (kind of stripped down version of BCPL) around 1969 [^1f]. In
1971, [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) started to
improve the [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)) language
and called this new language *New B* or *NB*, in short. After several
modifications to B, he decided to give a distinct name to this modified B
language and created the C language in **1972**.

```

But why the name C? It is believed that Ritchie selected the letter C (the next
letter after B in the English alphabet) because the language actually was
derived from the B programming language [^2f]. Another less common theory is as
follows. We know that B had derived from BCPL. Ritchie chose the name C because
the letter after B is C in B**C**PL. If there was a third language after C, that
would be P language, not D. We are not sure about the reason because as far as I
know, Ritchie didn't explain the rationale behind selecting this name. By the
way, there is a D programming language, but it is not considered as successor of
C. The language derived from C is C++.

6 years after the birth of C, in **1978**, [Brian
Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and Ritchie published
[The C Programming
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) book.
This book is very well known and still very famous today. It is the *bible* of
C. The version of C explained in that book is known as **K&R C** (notice that K
and R are initials of surnames of the authors). At that time, the C language was
not yet standardized as it is today. This book considered as the standard for
the language that was not standardized formally in 1978. The C version described
in this book can also be called as **C78**, although it is very uncommon.

This is one of the first programming books having the classical *Hello World*
example.

```c
printf("hello, world\n");
```

```

## 80s

Around 1983, the first standardization committee was established by [ANSI
(American National Standards Institute)](https://www.ansi.org/). In 1989, ANSI
published the first C standard, known as **ANSI C** or **C89**. In 1990, [ISO
(International Organization for Standardization)](https://www.ansi.org/) adopted
the ANSI C standard, did non-technical modifications and published **ISO C** or
**C90** standard. Indeed, all four of them (ANSI C, C89, ISO C and C90) refer to
the same standard, and today they are used interchangeably. Until publication of
the first standard in 1989, K&R C (the C explained in the book) was the *de
facto* standard. In 1988, the same authors (K&R) published the second and the
last version of The C Programming Language [^5f]. This edition covers the ANSI C
standard. The following standards have only been published by ISO, and ANSI has
not published any other standard.

The C version used between birth of C (around 1970) and the first standard
(1989/1990) is also known as **classic C** or **traditional C**.

## 90s

Several modifications were done to the rules of the language after the first
standard. The second major standard known as **C99** was published in **1999**.
Before C99, **C95** was published in **1995**, but there are no significant
differences between C95 and C90. **However, the differences between C90 (ANSI C,
ISO C or C89, whatever you choose) and C99 are significant.**

```{hint}
Today, most of the programmers talk about C99 when they say C.
I observe that C99 is the dominant version, especially in the embedded world.
Yes, it is quite old, but this is the case.
```

## The Birth of C++

The first C++ standard was published in 1998 as C++98. Today, the C exists in
C++ differs from the C language itself. The C++ developers created a modified C
within the C++ language. The C supported in C++ isn't exactly the same as the C
programming language. They fixed some ambiguous rules and add new features to
C90 while preparing C++98. Since they were creating a new language, they had no
concerns (almost) like backward compatibility, and they were free to do whatever
they want. Some suitable features and corrections done by C++ developers are
[back ported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting) to the C language with
C99, so to speak.

## 2000s

In **2011**, the third major standard, **C11**, was published. Some new features
like **multi-threading** are added to the language with this version.

In **2018**, **C17** (also known as **C18**) was published. C17 didn't introduce
new features to the language, and only did some technical corrections and
clarifications to specifications in C11.

The next version after C17 is C23. The new version is expected to be
published in 2024 as **C23** [^3f], [^4f], [^7f].

## Summary

The standards can be summarized as follows. Please keep in mind that the C
language was born in 1972.

| Year      | Informal Name(s)        | Formal Standard Name(s)                |

*At that moment, C23 is expected to finalized in 2024.*

## UNIX and C

At the beginning, I said that C is a byproduct of the UNIX project. Now, let's
look at the history of UNIX briefly.

In 1964, MIT started to a new project. The main aim of this project was creating
a time-sharing operating system to allow multiple users to use expensive
computers. This is the famous [Multics ("MULTiplexed Information and Computing
Service")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics) operating system project.
There were 3 big players in the project: MIT, General Electric and Bell Labs.
One of the participants from Bell Labs was Ken Thompson. After some time and for
some reason, Bell Labs withdrew from the project and they decided to design
their own operating system. The name of this project is
[UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix). The word Unix is sort of a word
joke, M in Multics stands for "Multiplexed" and U stands for "Uniplexed"
although both of them target multi-user usage [^6f].

Thompson and his colleagues started to work on DEC PDP-7. First, they started to
write UNIX in assembly language after then they thought that getting help from a
higher level language could be a good idea. In those days, BCPL was a popular
system programming language. BCPL had been derived from CPL and CPL is successor
of Algol. While working with BCPL, Ken Thompson created a B language and then
Dennis Ritchie continued to work on B and created the C language. So, we can say
that Algol is the ancestor of C. Even they got help from higher languages, the
team was still writing UNIX in assembly. In 1971, the first version of UNIX was
released. This was before creation of the C.

After a couple of years, the UNIX team started to port the operating system to
DEC PDP-11. But at that time, they decided to rewrite the whole project in C.
This is the first biggest success of the C programming language. In 1973, UNIX
was rewritten in C. Today, most of us would say that C is a low level language
like assembly because we know higher level languages like Python, C#. But back
in those days, writing an operating system in a high level language like C was
revolutionary. Before C the main language of operating systems was assembly. Can
you feel the pain? Porting an assembly program to another architecture is
[PITA](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pain_in_the_ass). But once you write a
program in C and if you have a compiler for the target architecture, then you
can easily port the program. UNIX is not an exception, it had a little
architecture dependent assembly code, but most of the code was in portable C.

In 1978, K&R published The C Programming Language book. Besides being the first
book on the C language, it also covered UNIX and UNIX programming.

In programming languages word, it is common that a language is influenced by its
predecessors and this is true for C.

In summary:

```text
  1957    1958    1963    1967   1969   1972   1985    …

FORTRAN → ALGOL →  CPL  → BCPL →   B  →   C   →  C++  → …
```

## Personal Computers and C

The personal computer revolution had begun in the early 1980s. For example, IBM
released their famous Personal Computer (PC) in those years. Nowadays, the C
language is mainly used in embedded world, operating systems and system
programming. But with personal computer revolution, C was preferred for almost
all kind of programs. C became a great choice not only for operating system
programmers but for all programmers.
