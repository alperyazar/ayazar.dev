# ðŸ¤– artificial

C is an **artificial language**. You might say

Indeed, this argument holds merit. However, it's noteworthy that some
programming languages bear a closer resemblance to natural languages, such as
English or Turkish, compared to others. Take, for instance, our venerable
[COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL), which dates back to the 1960s.

```cobol
ADD 1 TO x
ADD 1, a, b TO x ROUNDED, y, z ROUNDED

ADD a, b TO c
    ON SIZE ERROR
        DISPLAY "Error"
END-ADD

ADD a TO b
    NOT SIZE ERROR
        DISPLAY "No error"
    ON SIZE ERROR
        DISPLAY "Error"
```

It sounds closer to English, right? Or consider
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1';
```

It sounds like an English sentence. Now let's look at some C code

```c
while(n--)
  *p1++=*p2++;
```

This looks more artificial than COBOL or SQL, only `while` sounds like English.

Almost all programming languages are artificial, but like many programming
languages, C is closer to a machine than a human.
