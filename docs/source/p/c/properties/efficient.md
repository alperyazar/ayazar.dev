# ðŸ’š efficient

C is an efficient language. If efficiency is mentioned in a context, we should
question what kind of efficiency is being referred to. In this context,
efficiency refers to the number of instructions generated when the code is
compiled. Low-level languages like C and C++ generally perform more efficiently
in terms of execution speed and memory consumption compared to high-level
languages. For this reason, these languages are sometimes referred to as
**energy-efficient** or **green languages**.

From another perspective, high-level languages can also be more efficient. It
depends on how easily a program that performs the same task can be written in
the respective language. In other words, **from a developer's perspective,
high-level languages like Python can be more efficient than languages like C.**
While writing code in high-level languages is more efficient (accomplishing more
in less time), the execution of the code may not be as efficient as in low-level
languages. As a result, it is incorrect to claim that any programming language
is the best or the most efficient in every aspect.

Due to its efficiency and closeness to (medium-low) hardware both in terms of
efficiency and level, the C language is one of the ideal languages for system
programming or writing operating systems.
