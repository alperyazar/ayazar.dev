# ðŸŽ¨ expressive

C is an expressive language. What does this mean, exactly? Expressiveness in
programming is all about how easily a language lets you communicate your ideas.
This includes conveying your intentions and goals to both the compiler and other
programmers. Thanks to its well-thought-out design, clear rules, intuitive
syntax, and semantic precision, C excels in this area. These qualities enable
programmers to write algorithms and programs in a way that is both
straightforward and unambiguous. This clarity and power are key reasons why C
has had such a significant influence on many other programming languages. For
those interested in exploring this topic further, there's an [insightful
article](https://www.embedded.com/expressive-vs-permissive-languages-is-that-the-question/)
available. Here's a notable quote from that article:

> A language is expressive when it allows a programmer to easily convey his/her
> intent, with errors detected early. In contrast to assembly languages, C allows
> one to constrain variables to hold values from specific types, so it is more
> expressive here. In contrast to C, Java allows to test if a value is within the
> length a.length of an array a, so it is more expressive here. Contrary to Java,
> Ada allows one to constrain scalar variables to hold values from specific
> ranges, so it is more expressive here.

Conversely, many newer programming languages, such as C++, are generally
regarded as being more expressive than C. It's important to note that
expressiveness in programming languages exists on a spectrum rather than as a
binary characteristic.
