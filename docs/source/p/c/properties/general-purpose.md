# ⭕ general purpose

C is a [General-purpose programming
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language).
Its efficiency across various platforms — including embedded systems,
Windows/Linux operating systems, and diverse architectures like x86, ARM, and
RISC-V — and various problems stems from its design. Unlike languages tailored
for specific problem types or architectures, C is broadly applicable. This
characteristic is shared by many well-known languages such as C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript, and Python, all of which fall under the general-purpose category.

However, there are languages specifically designed for certain domains or to
program specialized hardware, such as FPGAs. These are known as [Domain-Specific
Languages (DSLs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). For
instance, SQL is tailored for database queries, while HDLs like Verilog and VHDL
are used for programming FPGAs.
