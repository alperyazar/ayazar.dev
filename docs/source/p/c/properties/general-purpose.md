**C is a** [**General-purpose programming
language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose\_programming\_language)**.**
It can be used to solve different problems on many platforms (embedded,
Windows/Linux, x86/ARM/RISC-V, etc.) efficiently. This is true because C is not
designed and optimized for a specific problem type or an architecture. Almost
all known languages like C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python are in that
category.

However, some languages are created to solve some specific domain problems or to
program some special pieces of hardware, like FPGAs. These languages are called
[Domain-specific languages
(DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific\_language). SQL and HDL
languages like Verilog, VHDL are DSL examples.
