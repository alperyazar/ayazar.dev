# ðŸ‘® imperative

C is an **imperative** (**buyurgan** in Turkish) language. As programmers, we
explicitly control the state or flow of the program by writing statements [^1f].
Writing in C is similar to *giving orders to a computer*. Codes in C++ and
Python are also *usually* written imperatively. The opposite is **declarative**
(**bildirimsel** in Turkish). When we are programming with declarative
languages, we describe *what* should be done, but not *how*. With declarative
languages, we do not control the flow of the program explicitly.
[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and
[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) are typical examples
for declarative languages. Let's look at some examples.

The following code may be a part of a C program.

```c
//...

if (x > 20) {
    y = 5;
    foo();
} else
    bar();

//...

```

As you can see, we explicitly control the flow of the program by an `if`
statement and give *orders* by calling functions `foo()` and `bar()` and somehow
modify the program state by changing the value of `y`. Depending on the result
of the comparison of `x` by `20`, the flow of the program takes a different
direction. Each line tells the computer what to do explicitly.

## A Declarative Example

The following SQL code (query) fetches data from a table named `Users` stored in
a database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username='admin' AND PASSWORD='admin' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Unlike C, in that case we describe *what* we want but not *how* the database
engine should work to satisfy our query. We want a single row from the table
`Users` where both username and password are `admin` and if multiple users are
found, the user with the highest `id` is returned. Did we implement the sorting
algorithm used to sort entries? No! We don't care about the exact operations and
flow executed by the database engine, we only care about the result. But while
programming in C, we must give *orders* and control the flow.

## Computer Architecture and Imperative Programming

Actually, imperative programming paradigm is the natural way of computer
programming. Basics of computer and processor architectures haven't changed too
much since the beginning of the microprocessor era. Almost all processors work
by executing orders (instructions) sequentially. Some instructions (branch
instructions) change the flow that processor follows. From that perspective,
programming in C is very parallel to programming in assembly language, only at a
*slightly* higher level.

Programs coded in a declarative language run on the same processors. There is no
different processor to run SQL code or a procedural language. The difference
between these two paradigms come from the perspective that a programmer sees the
computer. Of course, the database engine executing SQL codes run similar
instructions on the processor as a C program. The engine itself could be
programmed in an imperative language, like C. In general, if you use a
declarative language, computer architecture becomes more abstracted to you
comparing to programming in an imperative language. This doesn't have to be
necessarily a good or a bad thing. As always, it depends on your needsâ€¦

## Functional Programming

Functional programming paradigm is a subset of declarative programming paradigm.
There are purely functional languages like Haskell. Nowadays, most of the modern
programming languages like Python or C++ have some tools that allow us to
program in a functional programming fashion (like lambda functions).

```{note}
A programming language does not have to be in either
category. Most of the programming languages are multi-paradigm languages
supporting both paradigm more or less.
```

## Summary

Notice that a language may support programming in both imperative and
declarative fashion. For example, in Python or in C++, one can program in both
paradigms [^2f]. **But of course C is an imperative language.**

```{warning}
Unlike many modern languages, C does not support
declarative programming paradigm inherently. It is possible to add some
declarative programming features to C with 3rd party libraries. However,
extending a language with 3rd party libraries doesn't change its paradigm or
category. The key point that, the features should be native in that language.
