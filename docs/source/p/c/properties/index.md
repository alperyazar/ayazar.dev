# ðŸŒˆ Properties of C

**What kind of language is C?** Programming languages can be categorized from
various perspectives, often referred to as **paradigms**. The characteristics of
the C programming language and the paradigms it belongs to are listed below.

Just as in real life, characteristics of programming languages aren't simply
binary (0/1); they often exist on a spectrum. For a given feature 'x', one might
say, 'The C language doesn't embody feature x as strongly as language Y.'
Moreover, different sources might classify C under varying paradigms or
categories, and some of these classifications can be subjective. The following
points reflect my personal understanding of these aspects.
