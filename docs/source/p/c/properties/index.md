# ðŸŒˆ Properties of C

**What kind of language is C?** Any programming language can be categorized from
different perspectives. These categories are also called as **paradigms**.
Properties of C and the paradigms that C belong are listed below.

As in real life, a property is not 0/1. Most of them lay on a scale. For a
feature x, one can say that "C language is not as much x as language Y".
Furthermore, in another resource, C can be said belonging to different paradigm
or category. Some of them are open to discussion. The followings reflect my personal
understanding.
