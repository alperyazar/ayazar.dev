# â¬‡ middle-low level

The level of a programming language is a measure of its position between a
computer and a human. Lower level languages are closer to a computer than high
level languages. For example, an assembly language for a specific processor is
one of the lowest level language available for that processor/system. On the
other hand, GUI based languages like
[Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) are
one of the highest level ones. Higher level languages create abstracted computer
models. Programmers usually don't think about CPU architecture, memory
organization, etc. when programming with high level languages. However,
programming in low level languages usually require more insight about computers,
otherwise one might not benefit from programming in a low level language.

We can divide languages into 3 categories according to their levels: low level,
middle level, high level. **C is generally considered as a middle level
language, though it is very close to the low end.**

When a C program is compiled, the generated assembly program reflects the C
source code line-by-line generally. Thus, sometimes C is called as a **portable
assembly language**. It is a compact and not an *over-bloated* language like
high level languages. Many high level languages have different sophisticated
mechanisms like garbage collection to ease programmer's job. However, the C
programmer is responsible for everything!

The level of a language might change with technology. For example, as I
mentioned in `History of C, Unix and C part ðŸ”—` rewritten of UNIX in C was a
revolutionary step back in 1973 because an operating system was written in a
high level language which is C! Now, we have Python, Java, etc. or GUI based
languages like Scratch or Simulink, and they sit at far higher level than C in
today. In the future, the positions could be change and they could become middle
level language.
