# ðŸ†“ non-proprietary

C is a non-proprietary language, meaning it isn't owned or controlled by a
single group or company. In contrast, some languages are proprietary, developed
and maintained primarily to meet the needs of a specific organization. An
example of a proprietary language is
[MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB), which is developed by
[MathWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks). It's important to note
that being proprietary doesn't inherently imply a negative aspect; it simply
reflects a different model of development and control. In contrast to
proprietary languages, many well-known and widely used languages like C, C++,
and Python are non-proprietary. Their development is overseen by committees or
communities rather than being dictated by a single corporate entity.
