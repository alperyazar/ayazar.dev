# ðŸ†“ non-proprietary

Some languages are proprietary. These languages belong to a group, or they are
controlled by companies to primarily satisfy their needs. For example,
[MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) (programming language) from
[MathWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks) is in this category. Of
course, being a proprietary language does not mean necessarily a bad thing. On
the other hand, most of the well-known and widespread languages like C, C++,
Python are non-proprietary languages. Their development is guided by a
committee, not by a single company.

**C is a non-proprietary language.**
