# ðŸ““ standard

C is a standardized programming language. It has formal standard documents
published by ISO. Widespread languages like Python, Perl **are not** formally
standardized unlike C, instead they have some documents serve as a *de-facto*
standard. Remember that [The C Programming Language
book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) was de-facto C
standard between 1978 and 1989 (until the first standardization of C).

Names of the official C standards are in `ISO/IEC 9899:<YEAR>` format.  For
example, the official name of the C11 is [ISO/IEC
9899:2011](https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html).

There are high quality and both community driven and company driven C compilers
like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang/LLVM](https://clang.llvm.org/),
[MSVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B), etc. thanks to
the standards. Compilers that implement rules defined in the standards are
called **conforming compilers** (see: [](../glossary/conforming-compiler.md))

```{note}
History of C standards are explained in [](../history.md).
