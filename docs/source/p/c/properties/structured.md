C is a [structured
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) language. The
opposite of structured programming is [non-structured
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-structured_programming) or
unstructured programming. Here there are 5 typical characteristics of a
structured language:

1. **Control Structures**: Enables clear flow control using loops and conditional
   statements, improving readability and maintainability. C has control
   structures like `if`, `switch..case`, `for`, `while`.
2. **Modularity**: Supports dividing code into reusable, independent functions or
   modules for better organization and testing. In C, we use mainly functions to
   obtain modularity. C includes a standard library that provides a set of
   predefined functions for performing various tasks, further supporting
   structured and modular programming.
3. **Local Variable Scope**: Encourages variables to be declared within their usage
   scope, reducing side effects and enhancing code safety.
4. **Sequential Execution**: Maintains a predictable and straightforward flow of
   program execution within each structure.
5. **Limited Use of GOTO Statements**: Discourages the use of GOTO statements,
   preventing complex and unmanageable "spaghetti code." Although C allows GOTO
   statements, it should be used with caution.

While C is a structured programming language, it's also flexible and allows for
different programming styles. This flexibility means that it's possible to write
unstructured code in C, but the language itself provides all the necessary
features to support structured programming practices.
